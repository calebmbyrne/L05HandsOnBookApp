# L05HandsOnBookApp
used boiler plate from ionic woz-u to design a simple book app
Used, Woz-u's boiler plate code to start making my book app final for the module on Ionic cordova.  
I added 4 chapter pages with titles, images, loren ipsum text,  page numbers, buttons for navigation to the TOC (table of contents), the Next Page, and Back a page.
